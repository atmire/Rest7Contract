# Collection Export to ZIP Endpoint
[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

**/api/core/collections/<:uuid>/exportToZip**

Example: <https://dspace7.4science.it/dspace-spring-rest/#https://dspace7.4science.it/dspace-spring-rest/api/core/collections/1c11f3f1-ba1f-4f36-908a-3f1ea9a557eb/zip>

[It returns a ZIP file containing the SAF of each item in the collection. This is similar to http://demo.dspace.org/xmlui/admin/export?collectionID=99cb327a-e7ac-40ed-8540-03b86874149f but doesn't store the ZIP file on the server]
